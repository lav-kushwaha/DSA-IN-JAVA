HashMap and Hashtable are both data structures in Java that implement the Map interface, allowing you to store key-value pairs.
Despite their similarities, they have several differences in terms of functionality, performance, and usage.

#HashMap
Non-Synchronized: HashMap is not synchronized, meaning it is not thread-safe. Multiple threads can access and modify it simultaneously without any coordination, which can lead to inconsistent data.
For a thread-safe alternative, you can use Collections.synchronizedMap or ConcurrentHashMap.
Allows Nulls: HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values.
Performance: HashMap generally has better performance than Hashtable due to the lack of synchronization overhead.
Introduced in JDK 1.2: HashMap was introduced later than Hashtable, in JDK 1.2, as part of the Java Collections Framework.
Iterators: HashMap's iterator is fail-fast, which means it will throw a ConcurrentModificationException if the map is modified after the iterator is created, except through the iterator's own remove method.
