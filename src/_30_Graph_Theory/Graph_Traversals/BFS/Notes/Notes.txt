Breadth-First Search (BFS) in Graphs

#Overview
Definition: Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores nodes in layers or levels.
Starting from a specified source node, it visits all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

#Applications:
• Finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
• Traversing nodes level-by-level.
• Detecting connected components in undirected graphs.

#BFS Algorithm Steps

1.Initialization:

• Start from a given source node.
• Use a Queue data structure to manage nodes to be explored in FIFO order.
• Use a Set or boolean array to keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.

2.Traversal:

• Dequeue the front node from the queue, process it (e.g., print or record it).
• For each unvisited neighbor of this node:
• Mark it as visited.
• Enqueue it to explore later.
• Continue until the queue is empty.

#Key Uses of BFS:

• Finding the shortest path between two nodes in unweighted graphs.
• Traversing or exploring all connected nodes in a network.
• Level-order traversal in trees.
