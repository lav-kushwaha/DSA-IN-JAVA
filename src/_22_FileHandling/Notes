#File Handling in Java

In Java, with the help of File Class, we can work with files. This File Class is inside the java.io package.
The File class can be used by creating an object of the class and then specifying the name of the file.

#Why File Handling is Required?
File Handling is an integral part of any programming language as file handling enables us to store the output of any particular program in a file and allows us to perform certain operations on it.
In simple words, file handling means reading and writing data to a file.

#read() and readLine()

#read()
The read() method reads one character or byte at a time. It is found in classes like InputStream and Reader.

#readLine()
The readLine() method reads a whole line of text at a time. It is typically found in the BufferedReader class.

#Summary
read(): Reads one character or byte at a time. Returns the character read, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached.
readLine(): Reads an entire line of text. Returns the line read, or null if the end of the stream is reached.

Both methods are useful for different scenarios, with read() being suitable for character-by-character reading and readLine() being ideal for reading text line by line.
