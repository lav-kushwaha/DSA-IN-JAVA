#Segment Tree
A segment tree is a binary tree used for storing intervals or segments.
It allows querying which of the stored segments contain a given point efficiently.
Segment trees are particularly useful in scenarios where multiple queries of various types (like range minimum, range maximum, sum queries, etc.) are to be performed over an array.

#Structure
1.Tree Representation: A segment tree for an array of size n is typically represented as a binary tree where each node represents a segment (or interval) of the array.
The root node represents the entire array, while each leaf node represents a single element of the array.
2.Balanced Binary Tree: The segment tree is a balanced binary tree.
Therefore, for an array of size n, the height of the segment tree is O(logn).
3.Nodes: Each node of the segment tree represents an interval or segment of the array and stores information relevant to the query we want to perform (like sum, minimum, maximum, etc.).

#Construction
The segment tree is typically built in a bottom-up manner:
1. Leaf Nodes: Start with the leaf nodes. Each leaf node represents a single element of the array.
2. Internal Nodes: Each internal node represents the combination (e.g., sum, minimum, maximum) of its children nodes.

#Complexity
1.Space Complexity:
• The space complexity of a segment tree is O(2n - 1) = o(n).
2.Time Complexity:
• Build: O(n)
• Query: O(logn)
• Update: O(logn)

#Applications
• Range Minimum/Maximum Queries
• Range Sum Queries
• Range GCD/LCM Queries
• Range XOR Queries
• Range Updates

Segment trees are a powerful data structure that can handle a variety of range queries and updates efficiently.
They are widely used in competitive programming and scenarios where dynamic range queries and updates are frequent.

#Why Use It?
• Speed: It answers range queries and updates in O(logn) time, much faster than doing these operations directly on the array.
• Versatility: You can use it for various types of queries, like finding the minimum, maximum, or greatest common divisor of a range.

In short, a segment tree is a clever way to structure an array to make certain types of queries and updates much faster.
