What is SQRT Decomposition?
SQRT Decomposition is a technique used to divide an array into blocks of size approximately sqrt(n) (where n is the size of the array).
It allows efficient range sum queries and updates, typically achieving O(sqrt(n)) time complexity for both operations.

#Key Components of Your Implementation :

01.Block Construction:
You correctly initialize blocks to store the sum of elements for each block.
However, the size of blocks should be (n + sqrt - 1) / sqrt to ensure it can cover all elements in arr, especially if n is not a perfect square.

02.Query Function:

This function is mostly correct. It calculates the sum of elements in three parts:
Left Part: Elements before the first full block in the range.
Middle Part: Full blocks completely within the range.
Right Part: Elements after the last full block in the range.
The logic to calculate the sum is almost right but needs a small correction in edge cases, such as when l == 0.

03.Update Function:

The update function correctly updates the block sum and the array element.
However, there's a small discrepancy in how block_id is calculated and used.
