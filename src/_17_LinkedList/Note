while (current.next != null) {
    current = current.next; //Stops when: current.next becomes null, meaning current is the last node in the list.
}


while (current != null) {
    current = current.next; //Stops when: current becomes null, meaning it has reached the end of the list (one step beyond the last node).
}

Q.What is the Difference btw both while loop condition ?
=> So, the difference is that the first loop stops when current reaches the last node,
 while the second loop goes one step further, continuing until "current becomes null", signifying the end of the list.


NOTE : head == null, means no element and head.next == null means there is one element on head.
