//When to used stack and queues.

#When to Use Stacks:
->Use stacks for problems requiring Last In, First Out (LIFO) access.
->Common operations: push, pop, and peek.
->Typical use cases: parsing expressions, backtracking, managing function calls, and handling undo operations.


#When to Use Queues:
->Use queues for problems requiring First In, First Out (FIFO) access.
->Common operations: add/offer, poll/remove, and peek.
->Typical use cases: task scheduling, breadth-first search, implementing caches, and handling order-sensitive operations.



#Stack Patterns:

Use for problems requiring LIFO access.
Common operations: push, pop, and peek.
Typical use cases: balanced parentheses, reversing strings, evaluating expressions, next greater element.

#Queue Patterns:

Use for problems requiring FIFO access.
Common operations: add/offer, poll/remove, and peek.
Typical use cases: level order traversal, implementing caches, task scheduling, sliding window problems.
