//When to used stack and queues.

#When to Use Stacks:
->Use stacks for problems requiring Last In, First Out (LIFO) access.
->Common operations: push, pop, and peek.
->Typical use cases: parsing expressions, backtracking, managing function calls, and handling undo operations.


#When to Use Queues:
->Use queues for problems requiring First In, First Out (FIFO) access.
->Common operations: add/offer, poll/remove, and peek.
->Typical use cases: task scheduling, breadth-first search, implementing caches, and handling order-sensitive operations.
